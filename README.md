# hoursUpdate
A python program used to update volunteering hours of members in a community service club.
Though specifically intended for use by the Green Hope Red Cross Club, the code could be easily adapted for integration in different organizations. The code is currently formatted to use the 'Red Cross Club 2021-22 Hours.xlsx' and 'Nov Monthly Meeting Attendance (Responses).xlsx" files. 

The program will use a member list database and an attendance database to add 0.5 hours to each attendee. It will account for any spaces or capitalization variances in corrosponding names. In addition, to account for potential spelling errors, the program will list all names with high similarity (>=70%) to names from the opposing database. This enables the user to manually enter data in the event spelling errors occur. Example: attendee accidentally submits name as "Honny Apple  Seed ". Program ignores capitaliztion and spacing differences. Instead observes correctly spelled name in member list database and outputs following information: [johnnyappleseed hohnnyappleseed 93.33% similarity]
