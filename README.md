# hoursUpdate
A python program used to update volunteering hours of members in a community service club.
Though specifically intended for use by the Green Hope Red Cross Club, the code could be easily adapted for different organizations. The code is adapted to use the 'Red Cross Club 2021-22 Hours.xlsx' and 'Nov Monthly Meeting Attendance (Responses).xlsx"
